Issue: Payment Gateway Timeout During Batch Settlement
1. What Happened
At batch settlement time (02:00 AM), the settlement service attempted to send aggregated transactions to the external payment gateway. The gateway did not respond within the 10-second timeout window, causing the batch to fail and leaving transactions in limbo. Financial reconciliation teams noticed missing entries the next morning.

2. Why It Happened
The external gateway was under maintenance and operating in degraded mode, increasing its response times. Our system used a hardcoded 10-second timeout and no retry logic. Additionally, there was no calendar-aware suppression of alerts, so the maintenance window was not recognized.

3. How the Issue Was Resolved
We rescheduled maintenance notifications to feed into our release calendar and updated the settlement job to:

Increase the request timeout to 30 seconds

Implement exponential‐backoff retry for up to three attempts

Check against the maintenance calendar and postpone non-critical batches during known maintenance windows

After making these changes, the batch settlement retried successfully during the same maintenance period.

4. Likelihood of the Issue Recurring in the Future
Minimal. With calendar-aware scheduling and retry logic, transient slowdowns no longer cause permanent failures.

5. Steps to Prevent It from Happening Again
Integrate a “maintenance mode” flag from the payment gateway into our job scheduler.

Log all retry attempts and alert only if all retries fail.

Conduct quarterly drills simulating gateway slowdowns and verify that settlement jobs complete successfully.

6. How to Fix
Increase Timeout & Add Retries

Set the HTTP client timeout to 30 seconds and implement up to three retries with exponential backoff and jitter to avoid thundering herds

Calendar-Aware Scheduling

Integrate your maintenance calendar (e.g., via AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows or an internal scheduling service) so that jobs automatically defer during known maintenance windows
AWS Documentation
.

Implement Retry Metrics & Alerts

Expose retry counts and errors to your monitoring system (e.g., Datadog, Grafana) and configure alerts only when retries are exhausted.

Use Circuit Breaker Pattern

Wrap calls to the external gateway in a circuit breaker (e.g., Resilience4j or Hystrix) to fail fast when the gateway is unhealthy.

Test Under Degraded Conditions

Automate periodic testing against a staging gateway running in degraded mode to validate retry logic.
