Dear Concern,

Users are reporting that the “Transfer” button on the dashboard is completely unresponsive:

App Version: 2.3.1
Platform: iOS 17.4
Steps to Reproduce:

Launch the app

Navigate to Dashboard

Tap the “Transfer” button

Observed Behavior:
• Tap produces no feedback — no loading spinner, no navigation, no error message.
