Dear Team,

We’ve received multiple reports today that our internet banking service is unusually slow:

Date/Time: 2025-05-13 16:30:00 BDT
Impact: Pages take 10–15 seconds to load instead of under 2 seconds
Scope: All users across web and mobile
Symptoms:

Slow page transitions after login

Delays when viewing account balances and transaction history

Timeouts when submitting payments

Business Impact:
Customers are frustrated by wait times, support calls are up, and we risk reputation damage if this continues.

Please investigate the cause of the slowdown and restore normal performance as soon as possible.

Thank you,
Abir Hossain
Associate Software Engineer – IB Ops
